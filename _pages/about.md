Hello there!! I'm a technology enthusiast with a passion for web apps, devops and Native Android Mobile Development. With 6 years of experience in the industry, working at startups.

When it comes to Backend Python development, I have a strong background in designing and implementing high-performance and scalable microservices using frameworks such as Django, Flask and FastAPI. I'm proficient in SQL and NoSQL databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis, and I'm well-versed in technologies such as RESTful APIs, GraphQL, and WebSocket.

As a DevOps practitioner, I specialize in designing and implementing scalable, secure, and highly available systems. I have extensive experience in cloud computing platform AWS as well as containerization and orchestration technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. I'm proficient in tools such as Terraform, Ansible, which allow for efficient and automated infrastructure management. I'm also well-versed in CI/CD pipelines and tools such as Jenkins, CircleCI, which allow for efficient and automated software delivery.

As a Native Android Developer, I have a deep understanding of the Android ecosystem and the latest mobile development trends. I'm proficient in Java and Kotlin programming languages and have experience in using Android Studio, Jetpack, and Android Architecture Components. I have a strong background in designing and implementing MVVM and MVI patterns. I use this pattern to design scalable, maintainable, and testable code.

Through this blog, I aim to share my knowledge and expertise in DevOps, web app development and Native Android Mobile Development with readers.
